# task 1: perform basic mathematical operations
# take input from user
a=int(input("enter the first number: "))
b=int(input("enter the second number: "))
# perform operations
addition = a+b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
# Results
print("addition: ",addition)
print("subtraction: ",subtraction)
print("multiplication: ",multiplication)
print("division: ",division)
